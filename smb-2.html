                    The NES was so successful in the USA that the games console market in this region was revived, after the crash in 1983.
                    Nintendo of America (NOA) was building the NES brand with a sales message focused on family fun.
                    NOA rejected the original Japanese release of SMB 2 because it was thought that the difficulty was too severe.
                    Therefore, it wasn't seen as a good fit for the North American and Western market as a whole. It's worth noting the game had acheived critical success in Japan.

                    A game was released for the Famicom in Japan called Doki Doki Panic. This was a platforming game about a family that was trapped in a dream world.
                    The playable characters were the members of the family, mother, father, son and daughter. It's not known how the following decision was reached, but an SMB
                    sequel was needed for the North American region. The playable characters in Doki Doki Panic were replaced with Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad.
                    With this minor re-skin, the game was released as Super Mario Bros. 2 in USA and EU/UK regions. This is why the gameplay is so unique compared with other 2D games in the series.
