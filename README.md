## Objective
To setup a fan site for the early Super Mario Bros. games. The site is intended to be a source of intersting information about the series roots that would appeal to veteran and novice gamers alike. Super Mario Bros. was chosen because of it's popularity and continued success for more than 35 years. The classic games on the site are still enjoyed today, having been made available on various modern Nintendo platforms. The site will demonstrate the use for CSS and HTML, along with the importance of responsive design.

# User Experience (UX)
## Design Prototype
The wireframe images below were created using Balsamiq Wireframes. Wireframe designs are for desktop, tablet and mobile. I added two images of the console the game appeared on for descorative purposes because landing page looked too plain. My mentor advised me that the site would be better presented with all of the content on one page. The layout of the content across all devices remained the same after it was moved from separate pages onto one.

## Site Structure
The site is one page with links to different sections. The links point to the contact form and the links to external sites. These sections can also be accessed by scrolling down the page.


## Design Choices

### Fonts
The google font Bungee was used for the site logo with sans-serif as the alternate if the google font can't be loaded. The default font was used for the rest of the site. 

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was chosen to match the colours of the famicom controller shown near the top of the site page. The colours are a close enough match and the contrast was adjusted for clarity. 

* Background colour: #9B1D42
* Text colour: #FBF2C5
